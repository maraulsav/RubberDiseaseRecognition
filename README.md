Hi hi!
In this project, I made an Artificial Intellegence in the Jupyter Notebook that can detect disease (pestalotiopsis, oidium, and corynespora) on Rubber Tree.
Then, I connect it to a website using streamlit. This is my first time to do stuff related to machine learning, it results on around 93% validation accuracy. 
I am pretty hapy with it

If you wanted to know more about this project I made it into 3 separated folders..
1. Data Augmentation Folders (It is a technique to artificially increase the dataset's size)
2. Artificial Intellegence (You can see my Jupyter Note Book code)
3. Website (You can see my python code and requirements there)
The machine that are ready to use itself is stored in .keras file which you can found in this main folder
